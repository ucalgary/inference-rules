# Kevi

Kevi is a [business rule system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rules_engine) that provides a consistent way to express business rules for use primarily in Python, Javascript, and .Net applications. Business rule systems help externalize operational decisions from application code so that application systems can more easily adapt to changing business conditions and applications can avoid having business logic mixed with functional code.

Kevi is very heavily based on the [WebObjects DirectToWeb](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/WebObjects/Developing_With_D2W/) [rule system](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/WebObjects/Developing_With_D2W/Architecture/Architecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001015-DontLinkChapterID_2-BAJDAABJ), with control semantics from Foundation and Core Data in Mac OS X and iOS, and syntax based on CSS with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/#-nested-rules) and [Saas](http://sass-lang.com/guide#3) style nesting. See [wiki/Influences](wiki/Influences) for more information about design influences on Kevi.
